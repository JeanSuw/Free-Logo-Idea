# [Free-Logo-Idea](#table-of-content)

## [Description](#table-of-content)
This is a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

## [Installation](#table-of-content)
There are no starter code for this application,so it was build from scratch. However, this application requires the use of the Inquirer package to run the program. Version 8.2.4 is recommended.
```bash
npm init -y
npm i inquirer@8.2.4
```

## [Usage](#table-of-content)
This application wonâ€™t be deployed. Everything will run in the terminals. I recommended viewing the demo in the link below

To run the application you must type in:
```bash
node index.js
```

* [Insert demo here]()
    * Note for the video
        * A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the SVG logo maker and passing tests must be submitted.
        * The `README.md` file must include a link to the walkthrough video.
        * The walkthrough video must show all tests passing from the command line.
        * The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.
        * The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.
        * The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated SVG file, showing the file being opened in the browser. The image in the browser must reflect the choices made by the user (text, shape, and colors).


## [Test](#table-of-content)
Jest package is used for the unit test.

## [Credits](#table-of-content)
Without these packages and tutorials, my application would not exist today.
